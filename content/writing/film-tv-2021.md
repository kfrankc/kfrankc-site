[Possessor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5918982/) - A scifi horror that blends the 'sleeve' technology concept of [Altered Carbon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) with the cosmic suspense of [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

[The Trial of the Chicago 7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070874/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) - A historical legal drama with director/writer Aaron Sorkin's iconic fast-paced dialogues and an ensemble cast, including Succession's Jeremy Strong (I didn't even recognize him as Jerry Rubin!)

[Primer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) - An indie scifi with an extremely low budget ($7K!), and showcases perhaps the most convoluted time travel plotline I have ever seen in film (had to watch it a few times to understand)

Filmed before the pandemic & released during the pandemic, it was a beautiful reminder of a time pre-covid

[Minari](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10633456/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) - A drama that rightfully deserves its place as a nominee for Best Pictures, as there is nothing that better represents the American Dream than an immigrant family trying to make it in rural United States in the 1980s

[Weathering with You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9426210/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) - A romantic fantasy anime that shares some similarities with [Your Name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3), but nevertheless ranks high as a coming-of-age story about love and friendship
