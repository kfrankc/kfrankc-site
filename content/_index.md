Hi there 👋 I am a Product Manager interested in how essential industries embrace digital transformation and technology adoption.

I have explored this topic extensively at Microsoft, initially building telemetry platforms for companies to migrate to the [cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/end-to-end-telemetry-for-sap-on-azure), and later shipping a brand-new retail AI product called [Connected Store](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/connected-store/).

Before this, I worked at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), [VCLA](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/), [Daily Bruin](https://www.dailybruin.com), & others

I had a wonderful time studying data science at UW, and computer science at UCLA. In school, I was a [resident assistant](https://reslife.ucla.edu/employment/ra), [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/) organizer, and student lecturer on [cybersecurity](https://kfrankc.com/cs88s/).
