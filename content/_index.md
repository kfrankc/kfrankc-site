I work on generative AI products at [Typeface](https://www.typeface.ai/) ‚ú®

Previously, I worked at Twitter (now [X](https://x.com/)) on recommendations, ads, health, & more. I have also built data & computer vision products at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) to help essential industries embrace digital transformation and technology adoption

Before this, I worked at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/), & others

I received a M.S. in data science from UW, and a B.S. in computer science from UCLA, where I had the honor of being the class of '17 [commencement student speaker](https://samueli.ucla.edu/2017_commencement/). There, I was a [resident assistant](https://reslife.ucla.edu/employment/ra) and [LA Hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Hacks) organizer. I also lectured a 1-credit course on [cybersecurity](https://kfrankc.com/cs88s/)

In my spare time I like to [draw](https://instagram.com/bykfrankc), [read](https://goodreads.com/kfrankc), and (occasionally) [take photos](https://500px.com/p/kfrankc)
