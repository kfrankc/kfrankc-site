I am a product manager at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/), where I explore applied machine learning at scale

Previously, I worked on several products at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) to help essential industries embrace digital transformation and technology adoption: I have built [data platforms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/end-to-end-telemetry-for-sap-on-azure) for companies to migrate to the cloud, and introduced a new retail AI solution called [Connected Spaces](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/connected-spaces/overview/)

Before this, I worked at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/), & others

I received a M.S. in data science from UW, and a B.S. in computer science from UCLA, where I had the honor of being the class of '17 [commencement student speaker](https://samueli.ucla.edu/2017_commencement/). There, I was a [resident assistant](https://reslife.ucla.edu/employment/ra) and [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/) organizer. I also lectured a 1-credit course on [cybersecurity](https://kfrankc.com/cs88s/)

In my spare time I like to [draw](https://instagram.com/bykfrankc), [read](https://goodreads.com/kfrankc), and (occasionally) [take photos](https://500px.com/p/kfrankc)
